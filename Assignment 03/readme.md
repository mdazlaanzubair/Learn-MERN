# Assignment 3

### Preamble

Assignment is to develop an interactive and attractive website. Simply, an interactive website is a website that communicates and allows for interaction with users.

The thing that makes a website interactive is the ability for the user to actively engage with the content and various elements. [Ironistic, July 16, 2019](https://www.ironistic.com/insights/interactive-website-design-benefits/ "Ironistic, July 16, 2019")
